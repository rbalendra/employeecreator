## Installation Guide
Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have:
- ‚òï Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+
- üì¶ Apache Maven 3.6+
- üê¨ MySQL 8.0+
- üü¢ Node.js 18+
- üì± npm

#### üß© Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

#### 1) Clone the repository:
```md
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employeecreator.git
cd employeecreator
```
#### 2) Configure mySQL Database:
```sql
-- Log into MySQL
mysql -u root -p

-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE empcreator;
```
#### 3) Configure Application Properties:
Create ``application.properties``:
```java
spring.application.name=employeecreator
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/${DB_NAME}
spring.datasource.username=${MYSQL_USER}
spring.datasource.password=${MYSQL_PASS}
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
```
#### 4) Set Environment Variables:
```java
export DB_NAME=empcreator
export MYSQL_USER=root
export MYSQL_PASS=yourpassword
```
#### 5) Install Dependencies & Run: 
```java
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The backend will be available at ``http://localhost:8080``


#### ‚öõÔ∏è Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

#### 1) Navigate to frontend directory
```bash
cd frontend
```

#### 2) Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### 3) Configure Environment Variables: 
Create ``.env`` file:
```bash
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset
```

#### 4) Run Development Server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The frontend will be available at ``http://localhost:5173``


#### Frontend Tests:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
# or with UI
npm run test:ui
```
#### Backend Tests:
```bash
mvn test
```
## Challenges
- **Complex State Management:** Implementing efficient employee status calculation logic that considers both ``ongoing`` flags and finish dates
- **Form Validation Synchronisation:** Ensuring frontend Zod schemas match backend validation constraints
- **Image Upload Integration:** Seamlessly integrating Cloudinary with React Hook Form for real-time preview
- **Responsive Chart Design:** Making Recharts responsive across different screen sizes
- **Type Safety:** Maintaining strict TypeScript typing across complex form data and API responses


## Recent Implementation of [Pollination AI](https://pollinations.ai)
- Text-to-Image Generation: Integrated Pollinations AI API for generating professional employee avatars and creative portraits
- Pre-defined Style Options: Three one-click generation styles - Male Professional, Female Professional, and Creative Artistic portraits
- Real-time Processing: Fetch-based service layer handles API calls with loading states and error handling
- Form Integration: Generated images automatically populate the employee thumbnail field in the creation form
- No API Key Required: Utilises Pollinations' free tier for seamless image generation without authentication
